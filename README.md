# Web_Scraping_and_Big_data_analtyics
Scraping data about houses to rent from eight different websites involves using web scraping tools and techniques to extract data from various sources on the internet. The data can include information such as the location, price, number of bedrooms, and other relevant details about the houses available for rent.

Once the data has been scraped, it is important to perform data preprocessing to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. This may involve tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.

Data analysis techniques can then be applied to gain insights into the data. This may include exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and summarize the data, feature engineering to create new features from the existing data, and descriptive statistics to summarize the data distribution.

After data preprocessing and analysis, machine learning models such as random forest and linear regression can be applied to predict the rent of the houses. These models can be trained on the available data and used to make predictions on new data.

In order to perform these tasks, tools such as Apache Spark and Pandas can be used. Apache Spark is a fast and distributed computing framework that can handle large datasets, while Pandas is a popular data analysis library in Python that provides tools for data manipulation and analysis.

The performance of these tools can be compared based on factors such as speed, accuracy, and scalability. This comparison can help to determine which tool is best suited for the specific task at hand.

In summary, scraping data about houses to rent from various sourcesand applying data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning techniques can provide valuable insights into the rental market. By comparing different tools such as Apache Spark and Pandas, it is possible to identify the best tool for the specific task and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis. Ultimately, this can help individuals and businesses make more informed decisions about renting properties and predicting rent prices.
